# Predicting-Druggable-Proteins
Predicting Druggable Proteins from Primary Amino Acid Sequence
Druggable proteins are those that can interact with drug-like molecules and are used as targets for drugs that can potentially be effective in treating disease. Predicting the druggability of proteins is therefore a crucial step in the development of new drugs. Computational models that can predict the druggability of proteins using only their primary sequence is a time and cost-effective complement to the more precise yet more time consuming and laborious experimental methods that analyze the tertiary (3D) structure of proteins. In here, we will explore the use of machine learning methods for predicting the durability of proteins from their primary amino acid sequence.
